                <p>Altering your taste for the customer make sense in a business setting. You adapt to what your customers are used to and expect. But when I put that soup to my lips, I was in for a surprise.
The broth was a perfect balance of flavor and not too oily. The pork was cut into manageable pieces and seasoned to a nice finish. The noodles were not too hard nor soft, and had the right taste. I felt like I was back in Japan.
After finishing most of the contents, Melissa brought me a small dish of Mimi’s renowned “Hell Sauce.” Made from various fresh peppers and some other secret ingredients, it had a faint orange glow. I took the plunge and added a bit of the spice to the broth. Drinking it in, I realized that the sauce deserved the moniker. I had stepped into a benevolent hell.
The tonkotsu ramen is a popular item at Irashai 2. Many of the local FIT students and Harris employees will drop by for lunch. Complete with the typical pork bone broth, pork belly, scallions, nori, veggies and boiled egg, this is the perfect lunch for someone short for time. It was the first time I ate crab and mushrooms in ramen, and surprisingly it added a great taste to the soup.</p>
