            <p>Mimi and Kansan began their journey 30 years ago in Greenville, South Carolina. Formally, trained in French and Italian cousine, Kansan dived into authentic Japanese cousine when he and his wife decided to go into business. They've now brought authentic Japanese cousine to Palm Bay Fl where they currently reside.
